## Api usage 
You can check out the api docs at : https://lead-scorer-0l9n.onrender.com/docs

## Score logic
All the rule score are located in src/lib/scorer.ts
currently only having these roles const decisionMakerRoles = [
  "founder",
  "cofounder",
  "ceo",
  "chief",
  "head",
  "director",
  "vp",
  "vice president",
  "owner",
];

const influencerRoles = [
  "manager",
  "lead",
  "specialist",
  "consultant",
  "executive",
  "supervisor",
];

You can check out the ai logic in src/lib/aiScores.ts
But Gemini api is prone to error because of model overloading.
